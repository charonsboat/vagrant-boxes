# vagrant box setup (ubuntu-14.04-desktop-x64)

How to set up a [base box with Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/drm2/boxes/ubuntu-14.04-desktop-x64) for use with Vagrant.


## getting the base image

Download the image from [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads) (choose your best/closest mirror).


## creating the virtual machine

### VirtualBox:

Create a new virtual machine for Ubuntu:

- Give it a descriptive name. E.g. ubuntu-14.04-desktop-x64
- Choose the default amount of memory. E.g. 512 MB
- Create a new virtual hard drive (.vmdk). Choose dynamically sized and set the max size. E.g. 64 GB


## preparing the base image

On first boot, you will have to select the newly downloaded `.iso`. Continue through the prompts until you get to the "Who are you?" part of the setup. Use the following information to set up the machine:

```
Name:         vagrant
Machine Name: vagrant-box
Username:     vagrant
Password:     vagrant
```

After the installation finishes, run these commands to download and run the script:

```bash
# download the script
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drm2/vagrant-boxes/master/ubuntu/14.04/desktop/setup.sh -O "${HOME}/setup.sh"

# run the script as the base user
~/setup.sh
```

It will then ask you to confirm your sudo password on the first command that requires it. The script outputs all of stdout and stderr to a log file located at ```${HOME}/box-setup.log```As long as the script executes without any major errors, your machine is ready for packaging!

Note: If you get a "permission denied" error when running the setup script, you may need to enable execute permissions on the file like so:

```bash
chmod +x ~/setup.sh
```

### cleaning up your leftover files

After the setup script runs and the vm reboots, you can remove the two created files with this command:

```bash
rm "${HOME}/box-setup.log" "${HOME}/setup.sh"
```

You may want to clear your bash history as well, and you can do that with the following commands:

```bash
history -c && history -w
```


## packaging your box

Now that your box is ready for packaging, all you have to do is make sure your machine is off, and then run the following command:

```
vagrant package --base ubuntu-14.04-desktop-x64
```

That's it! You now have a box packaged and ready to use with VirtualBox!
